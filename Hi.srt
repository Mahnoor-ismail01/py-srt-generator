shakes hands at both

35
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,250

the stakeholders

38
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,250
the point

39
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,250
the owner works

40
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,250

fireman's right

43
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,250
in the sense to

44
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,250
the users device

45
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,250
is the requirement

46
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,250
which they may not

47
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,250
see or com

48
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,250
and at that point

49
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,250
this

50
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,250
the only improves

51
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,250
the relationship with

54
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,250
build up the track

55
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:58,250
the and

56
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,250
the other end

57
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,250
product owner help

58
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,250
the delivery team

59
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,250
or development

60
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,250
team to under

61
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,250
stand the vision

62
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,250
and that required

63
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,250
it's

64
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,250
this role as

65
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,250
kind of bridge

66
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,250
when the two ends

67
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,250
holding tight

68
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,250
the two corners

69
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,250
and effectively and

70
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,250
than the smooth

71
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,250
communication

72
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,250
nan

73
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,250
let us see the differ

74
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,250
the responsibility

75
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,250
the switch a product or

76
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,250
it has to undertake

77
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,250
the vision

78
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,250
the to owner has

79

of creating a vision

81
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,250
so that the does

82
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,250
that meant team

83
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,250
the early visualize

84
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,250
there's the expected

85
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,250
come by the use

86
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:31,250
it is

87
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:32,250
the product owner

88

the major early into

89
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,250
racks and collapse

90
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:35,250
it's with the users

91
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,250
to understand

92
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,250
their requirements

93
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:38,250
thus it is

94
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,250
really important

95
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,250
translate that

96
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:41,250
in a form of

97
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,250
vision to the

98
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,250
him

99
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,250
so it is

100
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,250
cool a significant

101
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,250

so that every

105
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,250
one talks the same

106
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,250
language and

107
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,250
the an identical

108
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,250
they're standing of the

109
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,250

110
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,250
make sure every hour

111
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,250
i'm from the goal is

112
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,250
lying to the best

113
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,250
this objectives

114
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,250
the product own

115
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,250
there should create a

116
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,250
the road map

117
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,250
which is a high

118
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,250
the tactical

119
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,250

their product owner

204
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,250
to get clarity

205
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,250
the feel queries

206
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,250
my mind as
